# Laravel Budpay

Laravel Budpay is a package that provides integration with the Budpay payment gateway for Laravel applications.

## Installation

You can install the Laravel Budpay package via Composer by running the following command:

```bash
composer require devmohy/laravel-budpay
```

## Configuration

After installing the package, you need to publish the configuration file. Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Devmohy\Budpay\BudpayServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `budpay.php` configuration file in the `config` directory of your Laravel application. Open the file and set your Budpay secret key:

```php
<?php

return [

    /**
     * Public Key From Budpay Dashboard
     *
     */
    'publicKey' => getenv('BUDPAY_PUBLIC_KEY'),

    /**
     * Secret Key From Budpay Dashboard
     *
     */
    'secretKey' => getenv('BUDPAY_SECRET_KEY'),

    /**
     * Paystack Payment URL
     *
     */
    'paymentUrl' => env('BUDPAY_PAYMENT_URL'),

];
```

## Usage

Open your .env file and add your public key, secret key, merchant email and payment url like so:

```php
BUDPAY_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
BUDPAY_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
BUDPAY_PAYMENT_URL=https://api.budpay.com/api
```

Set up routes and controller methods like so:

```php
Route::post('/pay', [App\Http\Controllers\PaymentController::class, 'redirectToGateway'])->name('pay');

Route::get('/payment/callback', [App\Http\Controllers\PaymentController::class, 'handleGatewayCallback']);
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

use App\Http\Requests;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;
use Budpay;

class PaymentController extends Controller
{

    /**
     * Redirect the User to Budpay Payment Page
     * @return Url
     */
    public function redirectToGateway()
    {
        try{
            return Budpay::getAuthorizationUrl()->redirectNow();
        }catch(\Exception $e) {
            return Redirect::back()->withMessage(['msg'=>'The budpay token has expired. Please refresh the page and try again.', 'type'=>'error']);
        }        
    }

    /**
     * Obtain Budpay payment information
     * @return void
     */
    public function handleGatewayCallback()
    {
        $paymentDetails = Budpay::getPaymentData();

        dd($paymentDetails);
        // Now you have the payment details,
        // you can then redirect or do whatever you want
    }
}
```

The Laravel Budpay package offers several methods to facilitate integration with the Budpay payment gateway in Laravel applications. Here are the key methods provided by the package:
## - Accept payment

```php
/*
* This convenient method handles the behind-the-scenes tasks of sending a POST request with the * form data to the Budpay API. It takes care of all the necessary steps, including obtaining 
* the authorization URL and redirecting the user to the Budpay Payment Page. We've abstracted
* away all the complexities, allowing you to focus on your coding tasks without worrying about  * these implementation details. So go ahead, enjoy your coding journey while we handle the rest!
*/
Budpay::getAuthorizationUrl()->redirectNow();

/**
 * This method gets all the transactions that have occurred
 * @returns array
 */
Budpay::getAllTransactions();

/**
 * This method Initiate a payment request using Budpay Standard Checkout
 * Included the option to pass the payload to this method for situations
 * when the payload is built on the fly (not passed to the controller from a view)
